## ggobi/rggobi on OS X

Currently, the easiest way to get rggobi on OS X is to build Gtk2 and ggobi from source using homebrew. This is relatively simple:

```
# Install homebrew (if you don't already have it)
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

# Install ggobi from source
brew tap brewsci/science
brew install ggobi
brew install libxml2

# Set up PKG_CONFIG_PATH so rggobi can find all the pieces
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib/pkgconfig

R
install.packages("rggobi", type = "source")
```
